A Mock Restaurant Reservation System

- Two categories of users / customers: guest user or registered user. 
- Users should be able to search for a table and reserve.  
   - User doesnâ€™t need to login to the system to reserve a table. If registered users, they can login. 
   - User enters name, phone, email, date and time (date picker), and # of guests for dining and system presents available tables. 
   - Tables have maximum capacity limit i.e., 2, 4, 6, or 8. 
   - Different combinations are allowed, and owner accommodates the seating, for example: someone requests 8 guests and table for 8 is not available but 2 + 6, or 4+4 is     available. System should combine the tables and notify owner they need to combine tables. In this case System reserves both tables.
- If a guest user i.e., not a registered user, system should prompt user to register (Optional) before finalizing the reservation. 
- Registered users will have these fields: 
   - Name, mailing address, billing address (checkbox if same as mailing address), Preferred Diner # (system generated), Earned points (based on $ spent i.e., $1 is 1         point), preferred payment method (cash, credit, check). 
- System should track high traffic days / weekends and a hold fee is required i.e. July 4th will require valid credit card on system to reserve the table. 
	- Notify user no show will have minimum $10 charge.
